This program simulates an ecosystem, featuring various elements such as animals and their interactions—mating, hunting, and chasing—through the use of different strategies. It also models food sources and is represented with a graphical user interface built using Java Swing. The design follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles with Java and adheres to MVP pattern. Additionally, the Observer pattern is employed for the graphical user interface to manage updates and interactions efficiently. Factories are implemented to enhance modularity and scalability. This is the final phase of a project that has been progressively developed through iterative enhancements, forming part of an individual academic software engineering project at the University Complutense of Madrid (UCM).
